    "generalInfo": {
      "description": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, known for its vibrant blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere. It is an ice giant composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and water, ammonia, and methane ices.",
      "namesake": "Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea.",
      "age": "The planet's discovery dates back to 1846 by astronomers Urbain Le Verrier and Johann Galle."
    },
    "potentialForLife": {
      "description": "Neptune's extreme cold, high atmospheric pressure, and lack of a solid surface make it highly unlikely to support life.",
      "climateChangeImpact": "Neptune's atmosphere experiences dynamic storms, but these are natural atmospheric phenomena unrelated to external factors like human activity."
