    "generalInfo": {
      "description": "Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons, and weather.",
      "namesake": "Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called it 'Her Desher,' meaning 'the red one.'",
      "age": "Mars is often nicknamed 'The Red Planet' due to its surface appearance caused by iron oxidation."

    "potentialForLife": {
      "description": "Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.",
      "climateChangeImpact": "Mars' thin atmosphere and cold temperatures make it currently inhospitable to life as we know it."

      "axisTilt": "25 degrees",
      "seasonalEffects": "The tilt causes Mars to have seasons, with varying lengths due to its elliptical orbit."
