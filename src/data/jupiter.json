      "description": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface and a massive, swirling atmosphere.",
      "namesake": "Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods, reflecting its massive size and prominence.",
      "age": "Jupiter has been known since ancient times and is one of the brightest objects in the night sky."

    "potentialForLife": {
      "description": "Jupiter's harsh conditions, including intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and lack of a solid surface, make it unlikely to support life as we know it.",
      "climateChangeImpact": "Jupiter's atmosphere and dynamics are unaffected by external factors, serving as a natural laboratory for understanding planetary weather systems."
