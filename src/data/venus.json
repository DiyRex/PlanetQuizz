    "generalInfo": {
      "description": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size and structure to Earth. It is often called Earth's 'sister planet,' but it has a thick, toxic atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.",
      "namesake": "Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",
      "age": "Venus has been observed since ancient times due to its brightness in the sky and has been associated with various mythologies for thousands of years."
    },
    "potentialForLife": {
      "description": "The surface of Venus is extremely inhospitable, with high temperatures, crushing atmospheric pressure, and clouds of sulfuric acid. However, scientists are studying the possibility of microbial life in the upper atmosphere.",
      "climateChangeImpact": "Venus' atmosphere provides insights into runaway greenhouse effects, making it a cautionary example for Earth's climate."

      "axisTilt": "177.4 degrees (retrograde)",
      "seasonalEffects": "Due to its almost upright axis, Venus experiences minimal seasonal variation."

    "moons": {
      "number": 0,

    },
    "magnetosphere": {
      "cause": "Venus lacks a strong magnetic field, likely due to its slow rotation.",
      "effects": "The lack of a magnetic field exposes the planet to solar wind, which interacts with its atmosphere.",
